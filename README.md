## Features

### Ortholinear design

The keyboard features an ortholinear design based on the ErgoDox EZ.

### 70 buttons

The keyboard features 70 buttons to replicate a standard 60% keyboard as much as possible.
The Default layout is in swedish and has all the letters and numbers.

### TRS jack connection

The PCB is designed with a trs jack nicley placed between the tilted keys.
The two processors sent data through the serial bitbang protocol.

### Smart flashing design

I did not want to include a usb port on the right PCB i added two usb pins (D+ and D-) on both sides so that i could solder all the componens except the left processors and flash the right side easily.

### USB-C

The PCB features a usb type c port with capability to connect via a usb-c to usb-c cable or a standard usb-c to usb-a cable.

### 3D printable chassi

The chassi for the keyboard is 3D printable and is designed to be as small as possible while still protecting the PCB and the electrical components.

### Relativly low cost

The total cost of the key board is around 1 300 SEK.
Which is less than similar keyboards like the ErgoDox EZ.
